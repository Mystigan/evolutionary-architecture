## Dynamic Forms

Dynamic forms differs than static hardcoded forms, where the data for the dynamic form are customisable, and can be stored in the database/as json format. 

We can use json schema to set the validation rules for the forms. Some of the advantages of using dynamic forms is that the mobile app can just render it immediately without releasing a new version. Also, fields can be easily updated and new rules can be composed.

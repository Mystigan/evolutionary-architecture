# Metrics


- how to we deal with metrics gathering and collection?
- how do we track events from client side?
- how do we build a pipeline to process client side events?
- how do we handle errors from client side?
- how do we gather user actions from the client side and link them back to the user (using client ip will not work, since many users can share the same ip)

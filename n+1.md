# N+1 query problem


## What

This problem occurs when the code needs to load the children of a parent-child relationship (the `many` in the `one-to-many`). In other words, a query is issued for the parent records, and then one query for EACH child record is issued. Performing a N+1 queries will flood the database with queries, which should be avoided. Take the following example:

- parent: article entity, one article can have many authors
- child: author of the article, an author can belong to many articles

A naive query would be to select N articles, and for each article_id, we find the authors that belongs to the article.


```sql
-- Get the article id, say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
SELECT id FROM article LIMIT 5;

-- Get the author details for each article. Here an article can have many similar authors.
SELECT id FROM author WHERE article_id = 1; // 1, 2
SELECT id FROM author WHERE article_id = 2; // 1, 2, 3
SELECT id FROM author WHERE article_id = 3; // 1, 3
SELECT id FROM author WHERE article_id = 4; // 2, 3, 4
SELECT id FROM author WHERE article_id = 5; // 4, 5
```

Instead of performing an individual query, we can perform an _eager loading_:

```sql
SELECT id FROM article LIMIT 5;
SELECT id, article_id from author WHERE article_id IN (1,2,3,4,5);
```

Now that we have loaded the list of author ids and the article id they belong to, we can perform lookup on the application layer instead.

It is much faster to issue 1 query which returns 100 results than to issue 100 queries which each return 1 result.

## Common Applications

This problem is common in GraphQL, and can be solved using the `dataloader` library:

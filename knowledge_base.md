## Create knowledge base

How to learn real-world knowledge? Look at the conferences and the topics they are presenting. Look into those topics. Then implement them yourself. 

- paid courses. Don't need to pay for them. Just look into the table of content and google them yourself. You will end up with a different solution, but probably a better one and a better understanding of the topic in hand.

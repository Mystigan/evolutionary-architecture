## Dealing with hotspot keys


Frequent access of the same key in a partition is known as a __hotspot key__.

Common causes of hotspot keys [2]:
- The size of user consumption data is much greater than that of production data, and includes hot items, hot news, hot reviews, and celebrity live broadcasts.
- The number of request slices exceeds the performance threshold of a single server.

For go, use groupcache.

- Other solution includes creating mysql slaves for read only and a master for write only.
- Scaling is about managing resources.
- Use singleflight to avoid thundering herd

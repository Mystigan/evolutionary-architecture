# Location system

There are generally a lot of things that can be done with location-based services, whether it is

- sharing real-time location
- detecting current location and target location (what's the nearest place etc)
- estimating travel distance as well as time (how long does it take to go there, what's the shortest path)
- locating hot-spots (tourist attraction, historical places)
- marking locations to go/and not to go (because of natural disaster etc)
- mapping history/events to location (what's happening here/when, facebook's safety check feature)
- development planning (building a city, planning routes, zoning industrial area etc)
- demographics and geography


## Difficulty

device error:
- low end device might have lower precision
- location differs by device
- hard to determine location boundaries

user error:
- user input wrong metadata
- user provide multiple revisions
- ops approve wrong revision

## Confirm actions

Instead of a popup asking users if they confirm performing an action, show two number box `[ ][ ]` and ask the users to fill up the 4 randomly generated numbers to validate the action.

```
Enter the number 1264:
[12]-[64] [ Confirm ] 
```

This will allow less mistakes when performing action.

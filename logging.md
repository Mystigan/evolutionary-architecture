## Logging

See [here](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/ideas/blob/master/logging.md) too.

## Log Analysis

Log analysis seeks to make sense of logs generated from applications. Why do we need log analysis?

- compliance with security policies (any example?)
- compliance with audit or regulation
- system troubleshooting (how to detect fast?)
- forensic
- security incident response
- understanding online user behaviour (how?)

## Information from logs

- request url/query strings and fragments
- HTTP status code (2xx-5xx)
- user agent
- client ip 
- timestamp
- method (GET, POST...)
- hostname
- local server ip
- bytes downloaded 
- time taken


## Types of analysis

- top pages
- frequent errors
- country/city breakdown
- request count
- mobile first vs desktop
- speed


## Functions and technologies

More on this on [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_analysis).

- pattern recognition
- normalization
- classification and tagging
- correlation analysis
- artificial ignorance

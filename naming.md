## Naming Convention

- For entities, they must be noun. e.g. User
- For middleware, they can be noun ending in -er, -or or -ar to indicate some work being done.
- For packages, use nouns if possible. Don't use verb. E.g. log, as opposed to logger.
- For interface, use verbs, .e.g logger.

## API Naming

This is especially useful. Come up with the verb convention for your application (include it as part of the cheat sheet):

## AWS Infrastructure

Naming infrastructure can be tricky. There are several naming convention that we can adopt:

- per domain
- per team
- per category (using colors, fruits, pokemon name)



We might want to include the infrastructure naming too, like message bus, database, loadbalancer.

- different region
- different environment

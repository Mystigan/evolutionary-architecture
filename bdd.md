# Behaviour Driven Development Template

```
Story: (One line describing the story)

Narrative:
As a [role]
I want [feature]
So that [benefit]

Acceptance Criteria: (presented as Scenario)

Scenario 1: Title
Given [context]
And [some more context]
When [event]
Then [outcome]
And [another outcome]
```

This is similar to use case template. Again, this template cannot cover every single scenario, and we wre often left with common sense to cover the hidden scenario. But the actual focus is to ensure that value from the action are define, rather than just the outcome.
